# Image Denoising with UNet and Hyperparameter Tuning using Weights & Biases (WandB)

View notebook here - https://nbviewer.org/github/krishnams0ni/denoising_using_UNet/blob/main/denoising.ipynb

This project focuses on image denoising using a shallow UNet model with two encoder and decoder blocks, applied to the CBSD68 (noisy35) dataset augmented through horizontal and vertical flips. Hyperparameter tuning via Weights & Biases explored the effects of different normalization techniques (Instance, Group, Batch, Layer) and loss functions (MAE, MSE) on performance.
